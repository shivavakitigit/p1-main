          Welcome to P1 Heroes, the ultimate card game where driver knowledge is key! In this game, you'll be dealt a
          card with a driver on it, along with several stats such as experience, wins, podiums, and more. Your goal is
          to choose a stat you think is better than your opponent's card. But be careful â€“ your opponent might have a
          trick up their sleeve! Are you ready to show off your knowledge? Let's find out!
